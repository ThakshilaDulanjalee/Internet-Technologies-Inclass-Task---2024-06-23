                    A camera is an instrument used to capture and store images and videos, either digitally via an
                    electronic image sensor, or chemically via a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. As
                    a pivotal technology in the fields of photography and videography, cameras have played a significant
                    role in the progression of visual arts, media, entertainment, surveillance, and scientific research.
                    The invention of the camera dates back to the 19th century and has since evolved with advancements
                    in technology, leading to a vast array of types and models in the 21st century.
                    <br><br>
                    Cameras function through a combination of multiple mechanical components and principles. These
                    include exposure control, which regulates the amount of light reaching the sensor or film; the lens,
                    which focuses the light; the viewfinder, which allows the user to preview the scene; and the film or
                    sensor, which captures the image.
                    Several types of cameras exist, each suited to specific uses and offering unique capabilities.
                    Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras provide real-time, exact imaging through the lens. Large-format and
                    medium-format cameras offer higher image resolution and are often used in professional and artistic
                    photography. Compact cameras, known for their portability and simplicity, are popular in consumer
                    photography. Rangefinder cameras, with separate viewing and imaging systems, were historically
                    widely used in photojournalism. Motion picture cameras are specialized for filming cinematic
                    content, while digital cameras, which became prevalent in the late 20th and early 21st century, use
                    electronic sensors to capture and store images.

                <p>Beginning with the use of the camera obscura and transitioning to complex photographic cameras, the
                    evolution of the technology in the 19th century was driven by pioneers like Thomas Wedgwood,
                    Nicéphore Niépce, and Henry Fox Talbot. First using the camera obscura for chemical experiments,
                    they ultimately created cameras specifically for chemical photography, and later reduced the
                    camera's size and optimized lens configurations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col bg-success">
                <p>The introduction of the daguerreotype process in 1839 facilitated commercial camera manufacturing,
                    with various producers contributing diverse designs. As camera manufacturing became a specialized
                    trade in the 1850s, designs and sizes were standardized.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col bg-info">
                <p>The latter half of the century witnessed the advent of dry plates and roll-film, prompting a shift
                    towards smaller and more cost-effective cameras, epitomized by the original Kodak camera, first
                    produced in 1888. This period also saw significant advancements in lens technology and the emergence
                    of color photography, leading to a surge in camera ownership.</p>

            <p>The first half of the 20th century saw continued miniaturization and the integration of new manufacturing
                materials. After World War I, Germany took the lead in camera development, spearheading industry
                consolidation and producing precision-made cameras. The industry saw significant product launches such
                as the Leica camera and the Contax, which were enabled by advancements in film and lens designs.
                Additionally, there was a marked increase in accessibility to cinematography for amateurs with Eastman
                Kodak's production of the first 16-mm and 8-mm reversal safety films. The World War II era saw a focus
                on the development of specialized aerial reconnaissance and instrument-recording equipment, even as the
                overall pace of non-military camera innovation slowed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row bg-warning m-2">
            <p>In the second half of the century, Japanese manufacturers in particular advanced camera technology. From
                the introduction of the affordable Ricohflex III TLR in 1952 to the first 35mm SLR with automatic
                exposure, the Olympus AutoEye in 1960, new designs and features continuously emerged. Electronics became
                integral to camera design in the 1970s, evident in models like Polaroid's SX-70 and Canon's AE-1.</p>

            <p>Transition to digital photography marked the late 20th century, culminating in digital camera sales
                surpassing film cameras in the United States by 2003. In contrast, the film camera industry in the UK,
                Western Europe, and the USA declined during this period, while manufacturing continued in the USSR,
                German Democratic Republic, and China, often mimicking Western designs.</p>

            <p>The 21st century witnessed the mass adoption of digital cameras and significant improvements in sensor
                technology. A major revolution came with the incorporation of cameras into smartphones, making
                photography a commonplace activity. The century also marked the rise of computational photography, using
                algorithms and AI to enhance image quality. Features like low-light and HDR photography, optical image
                stabilization, and depth-sensing became common in smartphone cameras.</p>
